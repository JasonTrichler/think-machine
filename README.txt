Summary of the repository:
When someone makes a choice do they really mean it?

Goals:
1. Establish the value of a given choice between two options based on the relationship of previous choices.
2. Make that value quantifible in the form of a real number.
3. Use that numerical number to accurately predict future descisions.

Variables to consider:
CurrentChoice - The question that is trying to be predicted.
LoI - Likelyhood of impact. The probability that a previous choice will affect the current choice(weight the previous dicision holds Array of weights).


Concerns:
The delivery of the questions may impact the answers. so they questions will be presented randomly. Also, since the relationship between questions will be realatively weak questions with oposite answers will be used to more likely get accurate predictions.
